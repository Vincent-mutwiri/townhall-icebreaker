# Phase 2: The Core "Teacher" Experience - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Phase 2 has been successfully completed! We have built a comprehensive, end-to-end course authoring and management system that provides teachers with a powerful, intuitive interface for creating and managing educational content.

## ✅ What We Built

### 🔧 **Backend APIs - Course Management**
