# Media Upload System - Fixed Implementation

## Overview
The media upload system has been completely refactored to provide a robust, reusable solution for file uploads throughout the application. The new system addresses all the common issues with media uploads failing or not displaying correctly.

## Key Components

### 1. useS3Upload Hook (`src/hooks/useS3Upload.ts`)
A reusable React hook that handles the complete upload process:
- **File validation** (type, size)
- **Progress tracking**
- **Error handling**
- **S3 presigned URL workflow**

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { uploadFile, isUploading, uploadProgress } = useS3Upload();

const handleUpload = async (file: File) => {
  const url = await uploadFile(file, {
    folder: 'announcements',
    maxSizeMB: 10,
    allowedTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png']
  });
  
  if (url) {
    // Handle successful upload
    setImageUrl(url);
  }
};
```

### 2. MediaUploader Component (`src/components/ui/media-uploader.tsx`)
A complete UI component for file uploads with:
- **Drag & drop support**
- **Progress indicators**
- **Image previews**
- **File type validation**
- **Error handling**

**Usage:**
```tsx
<MediaUploader
  onUploadComplete={(url) => setImageUrl(url)}
  currentUrl={imageUrl}
  folder="courses"
  maxSizeMB={10}
  allowedTypes={['image/jpeg', 'image/png']}
  accept="image/*"
  buttonText="Upload Image"
  showPreview={true}
/>
```

### 3. Updated Presigned URL API (`src/app/api/upload/presigned-url/route.ts`)
Streamlined API that:
- **Validates file types and sizes**
- **Generates unique S3 keys**
- **Returns both upload URL and final public URL**
- **Handles AWS configuration validation**

## Fixed Components

### 1. AnnouncementManager
- Replaced manual upload logic with MediaUploader component
- Simplified error handling
- Better user experience with progress indicators

### 2. UpdatesClient (Community Updates)
- Fixed multiple image uploads
- Better validation and error messages
- Cleaner UI with proper previews

### 3. Course Editor Components
- **CourseEditor**: Cover image uploads
- **ImageModuleEditor**: Course module images
- **VideoModuleEditor**: Video file uploads

## Upload Workflow

1. **File Selection**: User selects file through MediaUploader
2. **Validation**: Client-side validation (type, size)
3. **Presigned URL**: Request presigned URL from API
4. **S3 Upload**: Direct upload to S3 using presigned URL
5. **URL Return**: Final public URL returned to component
6. **State Update**: Component state updated with new URL

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
AWS_S3_REGION=your_region
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_S3_REGION=your_region
```

### S3 Bucket Configuration:
- **CORS policy** configured for web uploads
- **Public read access** for uploaded files
- **Proper IAM permissions** for presigned URL generation

## File Organization

Files are organized in S3 with the following structure:
```
bucket/
├── announcements/
├── courses/
│   ├── images/
│   └── videos/
├── updates/
└── general/
```

## Supported File Types

### Images:
- JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Max size: 10MB (configurable)

### Videos:
- MP4, WebM, OGG, AVI, MOV
- Max size: 100MB (configurable)

## Error Handling

The system provides comprehensive error handling for:
- **Invalid file types**
- **File size limits**
- **Network errors**
- **S3 upload failures**
- **Missing AWS configuration**

## Benefits of New System

1. **Consistency**: Same upload experience across all components
2. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and validation
3. **Performance**: Direct S3 uploads, no server bottleneck
4. **User Experience**: Progress indicators and previews
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized upload logic
6. **Security**: Presigned URLs with expiration
7. **Scalability**: Direct S3 uploads handle any load

## Migration Notes

All existing upload implementations have been updated to use the new system. The old `uploadFileToS3` function in `s3-utils.ts` is now deprecated in favor of the new hook-based approach.

## Testing

To test the upload system:
1. Ensure AWS credentials are configured
2. Try uploading different file types
3. Test file size limits
4. Verify error handling with invalid files
5. Check that uploaded files display correctly

The system is now robust and should handle all common upload scenarios reliably.
